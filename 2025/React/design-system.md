# Building a design system with React in 2025, what's new? 

## Short intro

## Description

Design systems have been part of the world for more than a decade, some of them being provided and maintained by huge companies while other are a 100% lead by the Open Source community. With all the existing solutions, why would you like to create your own design system? 

In 2024, we started the endeavor off building our own design system, without relying on existing technologies, allowing us to deeply customise our needs and tailor the solution to all our users, both internals and externals.
Reusability, performance, standardisation, accessibility... The previous points are the some of the reasons why building from scratch can make sense.

After a year, from 0 component to more than 50 today, now powering more than 300 websites and mobile applications, with 500+ daily engineers using it, let me share with you our victories and our failures.
This talk direclty aims to show the road taken in building such design system, displaying our reasoning and the technical choices that we had to take.
